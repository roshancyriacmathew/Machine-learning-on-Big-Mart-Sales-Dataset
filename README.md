# Machine-learning-on-Big-Mart-Sales-Dataset
This notebook will walk you on how to perform machine learning on the big mart sales dataset. We will start by exploring the dataset
and performing various pre-processing steps to make the data ready for model training. Then we will train and test the model using multiple
machine-learning algorithms before creating a prediction model. If you want to know more in-depth on how to perform exploratory data 
analysis on this video, you can also check out my video on this topic as well on my youtube channel.
